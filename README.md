# error-detection-via-image
This is a similar AI modeling to AWS service of look up for vision that helps to detect error of chip by image capture. The idea of this model is to show that we can detect error in fabrication phase of the manufacturing process of semiconductor that leads to reduction in waste. It increases efficiency of the supply chain.
